If you do abandon the quest and the rod is destroyed, simply re-accept the quest (and keep it this time), and you will be able to continue using the rod indefinitely. The rewards from the quest are nowhere near as valuable as the rod itself - so don’t hand it in! Pro tip: this can be used in PvP to ‘fake’ casting a spell in order to bait an interrupt from you opponent.",
